# Overview
Spring is a Java framework designed to facilitate the building of large enterprise applications.

"Spring" generally refers to the Spring Framework, but there have since been many official projects built on top of the framework which have "Spring" in their name (Spring Boot, Spring Cloud, etc.). The term "Spring" could also refer to these projects as well as the original framework. A list of all the Spring projects can be found here: https://spring.io/projects

The framework is split up into various modules, but the main module is the "core container" module.
