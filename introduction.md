# Introduction
Spring is a Java framework designed to facilitate the building of large enterprise applications.

"Spring" generally refers to the Spring framework, but there have since been many official projects built on top of the framework which have "Spring" in their name (Spring Boot, Spring Cloud, etc.). The term "Spring" could also refer to these projects as well as the original framework. A list of all the Spring projects can be found [here](https://spring.io/projects).

The primary feature of the Spring framework is its ability to manage and configure "beans". Beans are just instances of Java classes, typically singletons.

Spring provides a framework to easily configure and instantiate these instances and pass them between other Java class instances, which are sometimes other beans. This is done by assigning each bean a unique name, which can then be used to refer to and interact with the bean.

The Spring framework is split up into various modules, but the most fundamental ones are the the "core container" modules.
