# Spring Framework Notes
Personal notes on the Spring framework.

Loosely based on the official documentation of version 5.3.7. A ZIP archive of the documentation can be found [here](official-docs/spring-5.3.7-docs.zip).

## [Introduction](introduction.md)

## The Core Container Modules
The "core container" modules of Spring are responsible for configuring, instantiating, and managing beans.

The four modules are the core, beans, context, and SpEL (Spring Expression Language) modules.

Each module is represented a Java package.
* `org.springframework.core`
* `org.springframework.beans`
* `org.springframework.context`
* `org.springframework.expression`

Bits and pieces of each module come together to implement a feature of the Spring framework, so it's not really worth it to go through each on individually.
